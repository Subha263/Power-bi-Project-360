  Dataset Understanding.
  ---
Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get good understanding of what are data available.
Dimension table : It will have the static data like details of customer and products
Fact table : It will have the data about the transactions

* gdb041:
  
 **dim_customer table contains following information**

**Post_invoice_deductions table**
* Post invoice deductions and other deductions details
  
  Importing data into PowerBi
  ---
As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing 
the Database access credential

Data Model
---
* Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
* Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
* In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
